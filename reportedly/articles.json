As indigenous peoples seek to secure the future of their ancestral lands, President Rafael Correa faces fierce political opposition ahead of a huge expansion of oil production into Ecuador's Yasun\u00ed National Park.", "By Nina Bigalke", "\"I'm sure, I'm positive that there is no road,\" Yvonne Fabara, Ecuador's hydrocarbons secretary, replied when I asked her about the operations of a state-owned oil company in the Amazon rainforest.", "She was referring to a particularly remote and fragile area of Yasun\u00ed National Park near the border with Peru. With more than 100,000 species per hectare, the UNESCO biosphere reserve is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. It is home to several indigenous peoples, including two tribes who live in voluntary isolation. Yasun\u00ed also holds an estimated 20% of Ecuador's oil deposits, a resource that accounts for nearly half of Ecuador's exports.", "Oil drilling in this part of the rainforest, called Block 31, was authorized on condition that no roads be built there. But satellite images published in a 2014 report revealed what appeared to be a road cutting some 20km into the protected area. Using these images, geographers from the University of Padua in Italy and a researcher from the Amazon Conservation Association calculated the road as being 26 meters wide.", "Despite the satellite imagery evidence from the report, Ecuador's government maintains that the oil company in charge, state-owned Petroamazonas, built only a temporary \"ecological trail\" in order to bury a flowline, in compliance with the environmental license for the oil block. The only way to know for sure would be to travel through this remote corner of the Amazon and visit Block 31 in person.", "Armed guards and military prevented environmental campaigners, the YASunidos, from entering Block 31 in 2014 (Photo: Yasunidos)", "Assurances by Secretary Fabara that the methods employed by PetroAmazonas in the sensitive area are \"being monitored by everybody\" were rebutted by Professor Massimo De Marchi, an expert in sustainable development and environmental science and one of the authors of the 2014 report. De Marchi said that independent on-the-ground checks in Yasun\u00ed are almost impossible due to the remoteness of the forest and the \"typical military and private security activities\" that surround oil operations.", "\"The problem is a lack of transparency,\" De Marchi said, explaining that myriad incompatible claims have intensified what is now a political controversy.", "Recent letters obtained by reported.ly outline how Ecuador's environment ministry refused two observation groups permission to visit the oil production facility in 2015, in one case citing environmental concerns.", "In late 2014, Ecuador's government banned a delegation of German MPs from visiting the country when it was discovered the MPs planned to visit Yasun\u00ed National Park and meet with people opposed to the drilling. Meanwhile, a group of young environmentalists called YASunidos were confronted by armed guards and military as they tried to reach the area earlier that year.", "Since no one else had been allowed to inspect the site, I decided to try and see the \"trail\" for myself.", "A heavy truck passes along the oil access road deep in Yasuni National Park (Nina Bigalke)", "Reaching the disputed location took me on a journey deep into the forest by boat and canoe along the Napo and Tiputini rivers. Inside Yasun\u00ed, residents from local Kichwa communities helped me to navigate the pristine wilderness and cross into Block 31, one of the latest oil concessions to be drilled. They do not want to be named for fear of reprisal.", "For days, all we passed in our canoe was an abundance of animals and dense canopies. As we neared the disputed location, suddenly a stretch of road rose from the banks of the river. To avoid being met by armed security, we continued past and doubled-back on foot, making our way through the forest with a machete. Our slow progress through thick undergrowth brought home the sharp contrast, when out of nowhere a massive clearing opened in front of us.", "Within minutes, vehicles approached. The rumble of a heavy truck drowned out the ubiquitous chirping of rainforest insects and birds. Soon after, a smaller truck approached. Both passed by, moving further along what was clearly a road.", "In the Amazon, roads are known to impact the habitat well beyond their boundary. Various studies, including a January 2010 research paper published in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, have shown that oil access roads built in other parts of Yasun\u00ed and its surrounding buffer zone \"have facilitated colonization, deforestation, fragmentation, and overhunting of large fauna ... and illegal logging.\"", "\"You typically end up losing at least all the large fauna like tapirs and peccaries and the large species of birds within a very short period of time,\" says Dr. Kelly Swing, an expert in environmental science and director of the Tiputini Biodiversity Station, a research facility inside Yasun\u00ed.", "To preserve the rainforest, the 2007 environmental licence for Block 31 stipulated a roadless design, where the oil platform \u2013 \"essentially an island in the forest\" \u2013 is serviced by a fleet of boats and helicopters, much like an offshore platform. To get the crude oil to a processing facility, the roadless access is combined with an underground flowline. This requires a temporary trail to bury the flowline before restoring the original geography.", "This method is significantly more costly than building a traditional access road, but widely considered best practice in sensitive environments.", "\"There is no need to have a highway there,\" Secretary Fabara confirmed when we spoke in late 2014, before I visited Block 31. \"Absolutely no need.\"", "The 2007 environmental license allowed the \"ecological trail\" to have a maximum width of 4.5 meters and a total clearing of no more than 10 meters tree-to-tree. Petroamazonas inherited the agreement when it took over the drilling concession from Brazilian oil company Petrobras in 2009. In 2011, Petroamazonas was permitted to increase the clearance width to a maximum of 14 meters.", "The widest point of the clearing I filmed was about 30 meters, more than twice as wide as specified in the amended license and about three times as wide as in the 2007 license. Satellite images show segments of the road where the clearing is much wider.", "The oil access road filmed by Nina Bigalke in Ecuador's Amazon rainforest .", "\"Once [the flowline] is buried, you don't have to have anything on the surface\", Secretary Fabara said when we spoke in Quito. \"You just rebuild whatever damage you did and it just evaporates.\"", "None of the experts interviewed by reported.ly know of an oil access road in Yasun\u00ed that \"evaporated\" or that was later revegetated with natural habitat.", "\"Yes, if we wait 100 years, we can have a forest, maybe,\" Professor De Marchi, co-author of the University of Padua report, said. \"But the problem is, it's a big investment. So, where you have a road, you improve the road, you open new roads. It's absurd to close a road. When you open the first cut, it's impossible to come back.\"", "One of several bridges built to cross rivers inside Yasuni (GeoYasuni.org)", "Furthermore, the morphology of the clearing has fundamentally changed and differs vastly from the pictures of a benign trail in official literature. The video clearly shows that construction materials alien to the jungle, such as compacted gravel, were introduced to build the road surface. Trenches were dug and satellite images show permanent \"water-crossing structures\" along the road.", "\"They had to cut the top of the hill to have less of a slope for vehicles,\" Dr. Francesco Ferrarese, geographical expert at the University of Padua, observed when he saw the video. \"I think this is extremely interesting, because it is difficult to restore the original morphology.\"", "In the politically charged battle over the right to define the future of an ever-shrinking territory of pristine rainforest, the road in Block 31 is significant, not least because of its strategic location. It lies directly adjacent to the last untouched oil block of Yasun\u00ed that until recently had been off-limits for oil operations: Block 43, often referred to by the acronym ITT, short for the Ishpingo, Tiputini and Tambococha oil fields within its boundary.", "In August 2013, President Rafael Correa abandoned a high-profile initiative to keep the oil in the soil, paving the way for a major expansion of drilling into the ITT oil fields. In April 2014, Correa's government rejected two thirds of 756,000 signatures collected by the YASunidos environmentalists to force a public referendum on the issue. Permits allowing Petroamazonas to drill were signed a month later. Set to begin in 2016, Petroamazonas has been granted the new drilling license.", "As with Block 31, the expansion into ITT came with promises to use \"cutting-edge technology\" to mitigate any impacts.", "A conference of petroleum engineers in Quito in 2014 foreshadowed \"the possibility of extending [existing] roads\" into ITT, according to Bill Powers, chief engineer with a USA-based consultancy, in an interview by the Guardian.", "Roads have been built into Block 16 and Block 31. ITT is the next concession slated for oil production. The fear is that road connections will be built through these blocks (Credit: InfoAmazonia.org/GeoYasuni.org)", "Presenting at the conference, a representative of Ecuadorian oil services company SERTECPET mooted opening road access to ITT through neighboring Block 31, Powers said. A Petroamazonas representative who spoke at the conference \"was quite honest and straightforward about the fact it was cheaper to put in a road than to rely on helicopters\" and that \"they had the intention of applying the same development philosophy in ITT,\" he said.", "A government official at that conference, Minister for Strategic Sectors Rafael Poveda, made familiar assurances that \"the transport of materials will be done by helicopter and by river.\"", "The issue has hit a nerve in Ecuador, not least because the OPEC member state depends heavily on crude exports. Oil resources are state-owned in Ecuador and, subject to market fluctuations, generate about half of all export revenues.", "Since the country defaulted on its debt in 2008, it has come to rely heavily on Chinese loans linked to guaranteed oil exports and projects involving Chinese companies. Further such deals have been struck as Ecuador's government looks to China and elsewhere to mitigate the impact of plummeting crude prices on the country's economy.", "Quito. August 27, 2013: A riot policeman holds a shield reading \"Life\" (written by protestors) during clashes following a protest against the exploitation of oil in the Yasuni National Park (JUAN CEVALLOS/AFP/Getty Images)", "Profits from record crude prices in the past had been ploughed into public spending on infrastructure, health and education, but four decades of oil operations have left people divided over the ills and benefits of the industry.", "For the local population in the affected areas, the impacts are impossible to ignore. Oil spills are amongst the most visible ones.", "More than two decades into a class action lawsuit against Texaco / Chevron, little has been done to clean up the toxic sludge and crude oil left behind in leaking open-air waste pits in a formerly pristine forest to the north of Yasun\u00ed. An Amazon Watch / Vice News expose alleged that Chevron tried to cover up the resulting environmental damage by deliberately seeking uncontaminated soil samples. Chevron public affairs officer Morgan Crinklaw disagreed, saying the sampling work was not conducted improperly.", "Above: The Chevron Tapes", "More recently, thousands of barrels of crude spilled into the Aguarico river after a Petroamazonas pipeline ruptured in July 2014.", "Although \"spills are the events that make their way into the public conscience,\" environmental scientist Dr. Swing stresses that in terms of environmental impacts, \"oil companies do many things even before they get to the point of extracting oil.\"", "\"Any oil operation involves thousands of workers. We are talking about developing small towns in different parts of the forests. We usually think of that as a minor aspect, but those are impacts that go on day after day after day for years, having a chronic effect on the environment.\"", "Such drastic changes continue to affect indigenous communities, some of who choose to live in voluntary isolation in the remaining untouched parts of the forest. Many have been fighting oil operations on their ancestral lands for years.", "\"The people that we are opposing, they tell us, 'If you continue, you will be persecuted,'\" a resident of Yasun\u00ed tells me.", "\"This fight is not for myself or my parents or grandparents, it is for our children, and our children's children, so they do not have to live in a contaminated environment,\" he continued. \"Otherwise, what are they supposed to say to them? That they are suffering because of the deeds of their parents?\"", "Above: A campaign by I Am Yasuni to create awareness of oil drilling in indigenous Amazon lands. The group was initially funded by Ecuador's government \"to help get funding to save the Yasun\u00ed,\" an organiser told reported.ly. \"When our efforts turned out to be successful, we were shut down and the government broke all communication with us.\"", "President Correa has taken contradictory measures through his quasi-authoritarian leadership. He shelters WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador's London Embassy while curbing press freedoms at home. In 2008, he initiated the first constitution to put the \"rights of nature\" on a similar legal standing as human rights. A crackdown on NGOs in later years involved shutting down Pachamama, an organisation advocating those very rights, after it publicly opposed the expansion of oil drilling in the Amazon.", "The environmental struggle has been exacerbated by what the independent watchdog Freedom House identified as a \"pattern of cracking down on [...] critical voices\" and a \"downward trend\" in freedom of expression.", "Leaked internal documents of Ecuador's intelligence agency, the Secretar\u00eda Nacional de Inteligencia, indicate that \"spies were targeting political groups and individuals seeking to conserve the forest,\" the Guardian's environment editor, John Vidal wrote. And Correa spent millions of Ecuador's intelligence budget \"to delete content critical of him and the first lady,\" Buzzfeed reported.", "As a direct result of the government's strong-arm rhetoric against environmentalists, \"the environmental justice struggle is now completely linked with democracy,\" says Ivonne Yanez, director of the NGO Accion Ecologica. \"This government accuses indigenous leaders of being terrorists and criminalizes young people for protesting against its environmental policies.\"", "Demonstrators struggle with riot police during a march to protest against the policies of President Rafael Correa they say will result in more mining in the Amazon region and threaten the environment and their way of life, on March 22, 2012. Protests were prompted partly by a recent agreement between Ecuador and China for industrial copper mining in the Amazon's Ecuacorriente Zamora-Chinchipe region. The march was organized by the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), a powerful umbrella group that represents natives from around the country. Correa accused CONAIE of trying to destabilize his government.

Valid concerns arise given the misleading narrative around production in Block 31 and the rebuttal of evidence that the environmental license was breached.", "Contacted by email about evidence of a road in Block 31, Hydrocarbons Secretary Fabara replied that she was \"most [concerned about] the information regarding Petroamazonas and the ITT as this is not within the scope of work.\"", "Fabara said she spoke to Oswaldo Madrid, General Manager of Petroamazonas, who was copied into an email.

Sporting a chin beard, spectacles and a cap, he looks like he could be from another era, save for his t-shirt. He's driving leisurely through an unknown central European town, matching the pace of the pretty song he's singing.", "At first I assume he's singing in German, but it doesn't take long for me to realize he's actually singing in Yiddish \u2013 a delicate, plaintive lullaby that's vaguely familiar. His gentle tenor voice is perfect for the song. It's a peaceful, charming moment, this man singing quietly to himself.", "And then he reaches the chorus.", "Raising his finger like a conductor signaling a choir, he lets out a brief \"ah!\" sound. The camera turns to the back of the van, and it's full of smiling people attempting to sing the simple chorus \u2013 a chorus I recognize from my childhood. Some of the people manage to sing it, while others are giggling too hard to keep up with him. A restless girl in the back seat appears to be attempting a handstand, her feet almost touching the van's ceiling.", "It's a moment of pure, unadulterated joy. And it sends a chill up my spine.", "The driver, Austrian singer Hans Breuer, is transporting a family of Palestinian Syrian refugees from Budapest to Vienna. Some of them are dressed in warm winter clothes, while one woman is adorned with with a headscarf. Hans, whose father was Jewish, volunteered to give the family a ride from a refugee camp to Austria. Once there, they would be able to catch a train to Vienna and beyond. To pass the time, he's singing the Yiddish classic \"Ofyn Veg Shteyt a Boym\" and teaching them the chorus.", "Watching the video for the first time was emotionally overwhelming. My team and I have spent the last six months reporting the horrors Syrian refugees face while attempting to seek sanctuary. For some of us, we've been covering the Syrian civil war since the week it began nearly four-and-a-half years ago \u2013 a brief period of hope and optimism that has since been crushed under the weight of barrel bombs, chemical weapons and despair. It had been so long since many of us had witnessed even a semblance of hope for Syrian families \u2013 and here it was in front of us, an Austrian Jew serenading a Syrian family as he whisks them to a future full of promise and possibility.", "The video is inspirational, to be sure, but it's not just the joy you see on everyone's faces. It's in the song itself, which I distinctly remember from my childhood in Hebrew school. I didn't speak Yiddish growing up, so like most of the other kids in my Hebrew school class, we stuck to singing the simple chorus \u2013 just like the Syrians were now doing.", "\"Ofyn Veg Shteyt a Boym\" translates to \"On The Road Stands A Tree.\" It's about a young boy named Itzik dreaming of becoming a bird and flying far away from to a desolate tree. He's trying to convince his mother why he must part from her.", "Zog ikh tsu der mamen: \"her,\nZolst mir nor nit shtern,\nVel ikh, mame, eyns un tsvey\nBald a foygl vern...", "Ikh vel zitsn oyfn boym\nUn vel im farvign\nIbern vinter mit a treyst\nMit a sheynem nign.", "I say to momma: \"Listen, \n If you don't stand in my way, \n then, one and two, \n I'll quickly become a bird...", "I'll sit in the tree \n And lull it \n during the winter and comfort it \n With a lovely tune.", "His mother is devastated by the thought of being separated from her son, but if he's insistent on leaving for a new home, she wants him to be prepared for a hard winter.", "Veynt di mame: \u2013 ltsik, kroyn,\nZe, um gotes viln,\nNem zikh mit a shalikl,\nKenst zikh nokh farkiln.", "Di kaloshn tu zikh on,\nS'geyt a sharfer vinter\nUn di kutshme nem oykh mit \u2013\nVey iz mir un vind mir...", "\u2013 Un dos vinter-laybl nem,\nTu es on, du shovte,\nOyb du vilst nit zayn keyn gast\nTsvishn ale toyte...", "And momma cries: \u2013 Itzik, my crown, \n As God would want, \n take a scarf with you, \n Lest you catch cold.", "\"Put on your galoshes, \n It will be a severe winter. \n And take your fur hat, too. \n Woe is me!", "\"And take your warm underwear, \n put it on, foolish child, \n Lest you become a guest\n among the dead...", "The boy, honoring his mother's wishes, puts on his scarf, his boots and his warm underwear. But the weight of the clothing is too much for him to fly away, as his mother's love for him is simply too heavy. So rather than tearing apart the family, he decides to stay with her, facing an uncertain future. But at least they'll be together.", "Kh'heyb di fligl, s'iz mir shver,", "Tsu fil, tsu fil zakhn,\nHot di mame ongeton\nIr feygele, dem shvakhn.", "Kuk ikh troyerik mir arayn\nIn mayn mames oygn,\nS'hot ir libshaft nit gelozt\nVern mir a foygl...", "Oyfn veg shteyt a boym,\nShteyt her ayngebogen,\nAle feygl funem boym\nZaynen zikh tsefloygn...", "I lift my wing, but it's hard... \n Too much, too many things \n Has momma put on\n her weak little fledgling.", "I look sadly straight forward\n into my momma's eyes,\n Her love did not allow me\n to become a bird...", "On the road stands a tree,\n it stands bent and deserted,\n All the birds of that tree\n have flown away.", "The video and the lyrics remind me of another family's exodus, 75 years ago. My great-grandfather came to the U.S. from Austria-Hungary at the turn of the last century, but much of his family stayed behind. As Nazi Germany took hold of Austria, his remaining siblings became refugees and were forced to scatter. One of his sisters hoped to join him in America, but he wasn't able to procure enough visas for all of her children. Faced with the choice of splitting up her family so most of them could reach America, or staying together with an uncertain future, they chose the latter. They were among the lucky ones: their patience paid off, and the entire family was able to immigrate to Australia, where their children and children's children still live today.", "Seventy-five years ago, it was European Jews fleeing their homes, forced to make near-impossible decisions again and again for the sake of their families. Today, it's Syrians escaping war and oppression, faced with many of the same difficult choices \u2013 where to go, how to stay safe, how to remain united as a family in such terrible times.", "Despite an uncertain future, at least one Syrian family has managed to stay together.", "And now they travel onward, with the help of a kind man and his song."], "threads": [], "title": "A refugee family, a song and a moment of hope", "topic": "Conflict", "tweets": ["https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305603677483008", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/765974448163794944", "https://twitter.com/msf_yemen/status/765302350001176576", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766297805895897088", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766292696956825601", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766304671019458561", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305246691921920", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766302365100236800", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766299187914895362", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766291838923837440", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766288337808265216", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766286798087712770", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310481392992256", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310546979315712", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310514712608768", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766298226349793281", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766285486402985986", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766300414421635072", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766295975178764289", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310399121784832", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766302313103364096", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310089120739328", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766288412785709056", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305754273972224", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766306352025272320", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766303101762564096", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766286578511642624", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310192812290048", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305693829824517", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766288280442798080", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766306243791192064", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766303710674903040", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766304241753419776"], "updated": "2016-06-09T11:40:28+00:00", "url": "https://reported.ly/2015/09/18/refugee-song/"}

But minefield locations were hastily or poorly documented, leading to frequent injuries even among Croatian security forces.", "An estimated total of 1.5 million land mines were laid during the war. Despite repeated efforts at de-mining after the war, Croatia was never able to clear its grounds completely. Mines have kept killing and maiming hundreds of civilians over the years, and the heavy cost of de-mining is still weighing heavily on Croatia's economy. Many lists of minefield locations exist, but none is deemed completely safe.", "Most landmines locations are in forests and agricultural land, that refugees are usually forced to use along smuggling routes. Their sense of safety \u2013 of being able to walk and travel in the open in Croatia \u2013 could make all the difference. One area with some of the highest risk is on the border with Serbia.", "Despite mine-clearing procedures being partially in the hands of private contractors, Croatia has several public bodies mapping mine fields, clearing areas and offering assistance for victims. According to one of these official bodies, the Croatian Mine Action Center, the area still at high risk covers about 505 square kilometers. Croatia plans to clear all suspected minefields by 2019. Suspected areas are marked by thousands of little red warning flags.", "But one of the most insidious aspects of landmines is that their location is not always fixed.

She was wearing a Cat-In-The-Hat cap decorated red, white and blue; how she wasn't sweating to death in this heat was completely beyond me.", "\"I came in all the way from Kansas,\" one woman chimed in. \"And my sister just drove up from Florida.\"", "\"We're from Palm Springs,\" an older couple said, over to my left.", "\"I just came in from West Virginia,\" a young man added.", "\"And how about you?\" she asked me.", "\"Oh, I'm from around here,\" I said.", "Around here. As in DC.", "She stared back and blinked, as if waiting for me to explain myself.", "\"Actually, I grew up in Florida and live up towards Baltimore now.\"", "Her smile returned, and the conversation quickly moved on to the unseasonably hot weather. Whatever concerns she might've had of me being from inside the Beltway had for now, at least, been deflected.", "THOUGH the Stop The Iran Deal rally was ostensibly organized by The Tea Party Patriots, the people who showed up to the rally clearly came to the issue from a number of backgrounds. There was a large contingent of Ted Cruz supporters, many of them sporting campaign paraphernalia. #TeamTrump seemed to have less representation, despite the fact that The Donald was scheduled to speak shortly. I probably saw 10 people wearing a Cruz accessory for every one person I saw sporting one of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" navy/golf/baseball/whatever caps.", "Pro-Israel activists were pretty much everywhere, including evangelicals and zionist groups, though an assembly of ultra-orthodox Jewish men held their own gathering across the street from the US Capitol, perhaps hoping to avoid mixing with women at the rally. One such woman stood just behind me, her three little kids in tow. She was wearing a tallis, a traditional Jewish prayer shawl.", "\"I'm told I should be careful about not dropping it,\" she told one her fellow activists.", "\"You're not Jewish?\" the woman replied, mildly perplexed.", "\"No, but I thought wearing it would be appropriate, all considering.\"", "The conversation was interrupted when another women came by with a large stack of protest signs reading STOP THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, the word STOP stylized as a red stop sign. \"Take 'em and pass them out,\" she encouraged, and the crowd around me happily complied. \"We've got bigger ones if you want one,\" she added, gesturing to a poster custom-made to criticize Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA).", "Mass-printed protest signs dominated the crowd, though there was no shortage of homespun posters. \"A NUCLEAR IRAN MEANS A 2ND HOLOCAUST\" read one in grave dark stenciled letters. Another addressed GOP leaders John Boehner and Mitch McConnell; \"REPUGNANT TRAITORS,\" I thought the sign read. Looking at it again, I discovered the word \"REPUGNANT\" was actually \"REPUBNICANT,\" which I assumed was an agglutination of the words REPUGNANT, REPUBLICAN and CAN'T. Or perhaps REPUBLICAN LUBRICANT, though that seems less likely, given present company.", "Some of the protesters made a point at taking a dig at #BlackLivesMatter, often using a play on the phrase \"American Lives Matter,\" sometimes affixed with the word \"Too\" at the end. Another sign \u2013 apparently the obverse of the REPUBNICANT sign \u2013 sported the phrase #JewishLivesMatter: Ask God.  I took a pass and decided not to take up the challenge, working under the assumption that sourcing might prove difficult.", "BY 1PM, the crowd had grown from just a couple hundred people to maybe 1,000 or more. The crowd was overwhelming white, though a few African American and Latino faces could be seen, scattered among the flags and protest signs. It skewed toward Baby Boomers, though there was no shortage of Millennials spread amongst the crowd. Meanwhile, after a John Cougar Mellencamp medley, the PA system briefly switched to Cheap Trick Live At Budokan, but then thought better of it after getting halfway through \"Ain't That A Shame.\" (Here's the rest of it in case you're feeling cheated.)", "Just as I was beginning to debate with myself whether the musicians in question would've approved or disapproved of their cameos at the rally, an emcee took the stage and announced that there would be over 50 speakers over the afternoon. Apart from a handful of keynotes, everyone would be limited to just two minutes. \"Politicians stopping at two minutes \u2013 yeah, right!\" exclaimed the gentleman next to me, my neighbors laughing in agreement.", "The first speakers seemed to pass by quickly \u2013 not necessarily because they were forgettable, though some of them were \u2013 but largely because much of the crowd's attention was focused on what was going on behind stage. A throng of security men, aides and photographers huddled together like penguins in a snow storm, momentum moving them forward ever so slowly. At the center of this mass of dark suits and cameras, a bright flash of orange caught my attention. Perfectly coiffed, orange hair.", "Trump had arrived.", "Of course, everyone had a job to do, so the speakers kept speaking and some of the audience kept cheering and booing at appropriate moments. But in my little corner of the crowd, all eyes were on The Donald \u2013 or more accurately, they were on that flash of orange hair that bopped along the center of the scrum, occasionally coming up for air. For some reason I imagined the TV character Alf, adrift and drowning at sea, his ruddy hair occasionally making it above the waterline.", "Trump had at least four other people ahead of Himself at the lectern, so he passed the time the way he does best, holding court and taking questions from fawning fans and press alike. Yet one speaker wouldn't allow the billionaire to suck all the air out of the rally.", "Sen. Ted Cruz took the stage and the crowd went wild; he definitely had home-team advantage. Sporting a pressed white shirt and striped blue tie, Cruz wasted no time making his argument against the Iran deal. His prior experience as a champion debater shone through as he went point by point, lambasting the specifics of the deal, as well as the people that are supporting it. His remarks were brief, but confident. It didn't matter that Trump was scheduled to speak next \u2013 Cruz would be no one's opening act.", "Now it was Trump's turn to take the stage. Just as he began to speak, several campaign toadies volunteers spread along the barrier between the candidate and the crowd, raising Trump for President posters above their heads. Perhaps it made for better television, but it didn't make for better stagecraft, as the signs now blocked the view of everyone in the front rows. While parts of the crowd chanted \"USA! USA!\" as he spoke, the front rows cried out, \"Take down your signs! Take down your signs!\"", "The sign-wavers didn't get the message, so the crowd up front did the natural thing \u2013 standing on the tips of their toes and holding their camera phones as high as possible, creating a chain reaction where everyone else behind them was forced to do the same. Even the orange luminescence that is Trump's hair failed him now, obscured by a tidal wave of iPhones, sweaty hands and irritated protesters. Any plans I had for taking pictures of him were now tossed asunder, as I too held up my camera as high as I could, snapping every which way in a pathetic attempt to capture him for posterity or something. The result was several dozen photos of clouds, trees, PA systems, out-of-focus security guards, and an occasional flash of Trump's head cropped down the middle.", "Close.", "Not much better.", "\"I could help you with that,\" a very tall young man said just to my right. As my luck would have it, he was actually talking to the very nice lady from California, who was struggling to hold up her Galaxy S6. She gladly handed him the camera phone; his lanky arms rose ever upward, somehow getting a pretty good photo of The Donald that would elude me.", "\"Here you go,\" he said to her once he was done with the phone.", "\"Thank you \u2013 that was so nice of you!\" she exclaimed. \"You're so sweet \u2013 your father certainly raised you right.\"", "\"Yes ma'am,\" he replied, \"both of them did.\"", "\"Yes, I see,\" she smiled awkwardly, before returning her attention back to the blur of orange in front of us while there was still time to do so."], "threads": [], "title": "Scenes from an Iran deal opposition rally", "topic": "Conflict", "tweets": ["https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305603677483008", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/765974448163794944", "https://twitter.com/msf_yemen/status/765302350001176576", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766297805895897088", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766292696956825601", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766304671019458561", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305246691921920", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766302365100236800", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766299187914895362", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766291838923837440", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766288337808265216", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766286798087712770", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310481392992256", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310546979315712", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310514712608768", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766298226349793281", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766285486402985986", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766300414421635072", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766295975178764289", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310399121784832", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766302313103364096", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310089120739328", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766288412785709056", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305754273972224", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766306352025272320", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766303101762564096", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766286578511642624", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310192812290048", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305693829824517", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766288280442798080", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766306243791192064", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766303710674903040", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766304241753419776"], "updated": "2015-09-09T22:10:36+00:00", "url": "https://reported.ly/2015/09/09/stop-iran-deal-rally/"}

Over 160,000 people, mostly from Syria and Afghanistan, have crossed over to Greece so far in 2015, with 33,000 of them having crossed the narrow 10km strait to reach Lesvos just in August so far. The island is overwhelmed by the numbers, but local social initiatives, with the support of volunteers and contributors from around the world, make up for the crippling deficiencies of the formal aid system to respond to people in need.", "Refugees reaching Lesvos are eventually channeled to two camps outside the city of Mytilene. One of them, Kara Tepe, is a converted traffic park, chicken-fenced and split down the middle by the access road, housing primarily Syrians. The other refugee camp, Moria, is an EU-funded formal detention center, fenced with razor wire and guard posts, housing other nationalities. Refugees at both locations are overflowing capacity, languishing in deplorable conditions, made marginally bearable by the efforts of volunteers and a handful of NGOs.", "Activists from the Village of All Together arrive in Kara Tepe in a staggered convoy, then unpack the materials needed to cook and serve food to hundreds of refugees. As the sun beats down mercilessly on the asphalt, Syrian refugees mill around, waiting for lunch to be served. The activists politely struggle to keep them from crowding at the table. Upon my remarking on the large number of people queuing for food, Konstantinos Polychronopoulos breaks out a big, warm grin.", "\"This is nothing; we fed 2,000 people yesterday.\"", "Seeing the cameras, a trio of youths approach and strike up conversation. Nahid, a young, bespectacled and soft spoken man offers to translate for the others. \"What do you think of Mr. President Bashar al-Assad?\" he says, signaling in a tone that one of his friends expects to hear praise. The friend is quick to laugh, appreciative of Greek women, and supportive of the Syrian president. He points to a muscled youth nearby, tattooed with daggers \"This guy almost killed me,\" he says. \"Just kidding.\" The dagger-tattooed youth is a shabiha, a member of the regime's armed thugs, as Nahid confirms later. The last member of the trio is a Kurd from Kobane. He offers no details on his story, other than to repeatedly point out that a united Kurdistan is within grasp as a result of the current conflict.", "Nahid \u2013 whose name we've changed to protect him from further persecution \u2013 tells me that he was a journalist in the northeastern Syrian city of Hasakah, which he fled after threats by ISIS over his critical Facebook posts. He tried to find work in Dubai, but he was told to fight for the rebels if he wanted a visa. Nahid complains about the unemployment and low wages in Turkey. He continues to post criticism on Facebook under his real name. All three want to seek asylum in Germany, without knowing exactly why. Smiling, Nahid poses for a photo, but I tell him that I won't publish it so as not to endanger him. After the others join the queue, Nahid confides that he's no regime supporter: \"I am a moderate; I blame all sides for the war.\"", "Kara Tepe offers sparse amenities to the hundreds of refugees arriving every day. Segregated shower stalls and toilets were installed by the International Rescue Committee and Medecins Sans Frontiers, but British expat Eric Kempson, who periodically comes over to help clean the toilets, criticized hygiene conditions at the camp. In another visit a month later, he conducted a spot inspection of the toilets \u2013 now in dreadful condition \u2013 and commended the International Rescue Committee for keeping the part of the camp clean and orderly.", "Today, the left side of the camp looks marginally cleaner than the right side. The only protection from the sun can be found at a small amphitheater, alternately used by police officers conducting registration \u2013 the entire reason refugees congregate here \u2013 and a Medecins Du Monde (MDM) contingent, performing routine medical screening. MDM also operates two more field units: one at the Moria camp and the other at the port of Mytilene. Refugees mill around the amphitheater, enjoying a respite from the sun while waiting for their checkup; a kid tethers to my phone's data plan to check on his Facebook page.", "Giorgos Bakas, the social worker who heads the MDM presence at the camp, is constantly busy, but agrees to talk to me at his office in Moria. We make a short stop at the Mytilene port, where the MDM mobile unit providing checkups and information is parked next to a registration booth. Dozens are crowding along a fenced, muddy strip, hoping to get their papers and catch a ship to Piraeus on the Greek mainland. Three children's drawings depicting homes are taped up on the fence.", "Moria is an oddity, a detention center where thousands are crowding to get in. Hosting non-Syrian refugees, for whom fast-track processing is not available, it has taken a more permanent aspect of a shanty town ringing the perimeter of a Gitmo-like facility, with razor wire fences and guard towers surrounding the containers housing the refugees inside. Unlike Kara Tepe, Moria has no amenities for those biding their time outside the camp. All manner of canopies  \u2013 from triangular field tents, to hiking domes, to silos and makeshift lean-tos \u2013 are pitched everywhere on the shoulder of the road. Dust rises with every movement, and waste water pools on the ground, only to seep downhill. Security issues also loom outside, as only a handful of police officers work at the facility and the road is ill-lit at night. The pent-up frustration of thousands waiting for an indeterminate time for their papers in deplorable conditions, with no amenities and care to keep them occupied, often results in scuffles.", "As we arrive, a long lunch queue snakes down the road. Medecins Du Monde and other organizations operate from a row of air-conditioned containers atop the camp. The entrance is ringed by tents, and their occupants plead to make their way in whenever the chain-link fence swings open. MDM's Giorgos Bakas tells me that his organization is operating at its limit, striving to at least provide the minimum of essential medical care and allow refugees to retain their dignity. But the island cannot handle over 1,500 new arrivals per day.  Better reception facilities are needed to manage the inflow and avert tensions, he says, and the EU has to respond appropriately.", "Sebastian Reich comes by for a visit, surprised that he was allowed in, and we make our way down to a dilapidated building outside the facility, where dozens of people find shade under the awnings that he and the team from The Village Of All Together erected. Their next project, to begin the following morning, is to dig a proper drainage system, as the pools of waste water are a serious health risk. They're also thinking of setting up a PA system, so people waiting to be called for their papers don't miss their turn.", "Solidarity activists and aid workers operate in overlapping parts of the refugee ecosystem, sometimes collaborating, often coexisting in mutual tolerance and occasional mistrust. Intergovernmental organizations and NGOs are constantly criticized by volunteers for their absence, or discrepancies between their communications and infrastructure work. For instance, Medecins du Monde also has a booth set up outside Moria, but activists say they've never seen it used.", "Back in Mytilene, Sebastian tells me that he never expected to be participating in such a social solidarity project, or to see so many people live in such dreadful conditions. Winter is coming, arrivals will continue, and the waiting will be harsh for refugees \u2013 especially once the volunteers, tourists and media are gone.", "...", "Not long after my departure from the camps, refugee arrivals in Lesvos surpassed 33,000 people, overwhelming all capacity at the camps and the port. \u0391 47-year-old Somali woman died of a stroke in Moria on August 31, reportedly due to the harsh living conditions, and another bitten by a snake was taken to hospital. On September 4, clashes erupted in Mytilene when hundreds of Afghans tried to board a ship to Piraeus, and the Coast Guard fired stun grenades to push them back. On September 7, hundreds marched in downtown Mytilene, demanding to be allowed to leave. A marathon operation to fast-track 15,000 applications for travel permits, on September 8, temporarily cleared the bottleneck in Mytilene, and defused tensions."], "threads": [], "title": "Lesvos Diary: Life in the refugee camps", "topic": "Migration", "tweets": ["https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305603677483008", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/765974448163794944", "https://twitter.com/VickieHawkins/status/629679565917569024", "https://twitter.com/asteris/status/635480002423857152", "https://twitter.com/lesvosw2eu/status/637696521966743552", "https://twitter.com/msf_yemen/status/765302350001176576", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766297805895897088", "https://twitter.com/asteris/status/638825638674100224", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766292696956825601", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766304671019458561", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305246691921920", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766302365100236800", "https://twitter.com/asteris/status/634696767028756480", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766299187914895362", "https://twitter.com/asteris/status/635481175004459009", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766291838923837440", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766288337808265216", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766286798087712770", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310481392992256", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310546979315712", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310514712608768", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766298226349793281", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766285486402985986", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766300414421635072", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766295975178764289", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310399121784832", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766302313103364096", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310089120739328", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766288412785709056", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305754273972224", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766306352025272320", "https://twitter.com/Donohoe_P/status/633660504179933184", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766303101762564096", "https://twitter.com/kallergisk/status/640790602444107776", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766286578511642624", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766310192812290048", "https://twitter.com/tsanga10/status/636490391257133056", "https://twitter.com/basakgucyeter/status/637618128881586176", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766305693829824517", "https://twitter.com/oemoral/status/636186167378096128", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766288280442798080", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766306243791192064", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766303710674903040", "https://twitter.com/reportedly/status/766304241753419776", "https://twitter.com/asteris/status/634683790758125569"], "updated": null, "url": "https://reported.ly/2015/09/09/lesvos-diary-refugee-camps/"}

The judge stated \"it is not in the interest of justice\" to hold the trials together. In addition, he also denied the motion to have State Attorney Marilyn Mosby recused from the case based on her remarks at a press conference earlier this year. Judge Williams said Mosby's comment's \"do not rise to the level where the defendants' rights to a fair trial have been violated.\" Freddie Gray suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in custody of the Baltimore police department when he was arrested on April 12, 2015. He died less than a week later. Our previous story:", "A video of Bexar County police shooting Gilbert Flores while his hands were up has surfaced. Last Friday, deputies in Bexar County, TX were responding to a domestic violence call when they approached Flores, who was in his driveway. The video, shot on a cell phone by a neighbor, shows Flores with his hands up when he was shot. Controversy has surrounded the video as the sheriff's office took to Facebook and Twitter to discredit local news station KSAT12 for airing the video, calling it \"unethical and sad.\" The office also took the unusual step of encouraging social media users to telephone the station and complain about the video. KSAT12 for its part released their reasoning, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in the county. A second video has also been reported, though it is not yet available to the public. Bexar County Sheriff Susan Pamerleau said Flores appears to be holding a knife and the video has been sent to Texas Department of Public Safety's crime lab. The two officers have been placed on paid administrative leave.", "Police continue to search for suspects in Lake County, IL after a 30-year veteran of the Fox Lake Sheriff's Department was fatally shot. Early Monday morning at approximately 8am local time, Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz was on foot-pursuit of three suspects and was found shot and stripped of his gun shortly after he called in the suspicious activity. Local police, SWAT, FBI and US Marshals went on the search for two white males and one African-American male suspected of the assault. Schools and libraries were closed down and a no-fly zone was declared in the area. Community members also held a vigil in his honor Tuesday evening.", "Despite dashcam footage showing Ernesto Rodriguez, 31, being beaten and arrested by Knoxville, TN police in July of last year, he is now facing resisting arrest and assault charges. Rodriguez, who is undocumented and suffered from severe injuries including having his face fractured, has filed a civil rights violation suit against the City of Knoxville and has turned himself in for the charges. A lawyer for the Fraternal Order of Police has said that police thought Rodriguez was going to be deported rather than \"clogging up\" the justice system. Police also claim he was not injured by the beating but by the moment \"his face smacked against the pavement.\" Rodriguez is set to appear in court on September 10.", "Three San Bernardino deputies have been charged with \"assault by a police officer\" for beating Francis Pusok in April of this year. Pusok led deputies on a horse pursuit in a mountain region that was caught on camera and broadcast live on local news. In an interview with NBC4 he said he thought he was being beaten to death.", "Murder charges for ex-police chief Richard Combs were dropped when he pleaded guilty for misconduct for the 2011 fatal shooting of African-American Bernard Bailey. The former police chief of the small town of Eutawville in South Carolina and Bailey appeared in court for a traffic ticket when they began to argue. As the defense for Combs tells it, Bailey got in his car and suspecting he was going to be run over, Combs shot at the vehicle. Two previous trials ended with hung juries.

He staged a play to inform theatergoers about the issue, managing to crowdfund 4,000 euros, and arrived in Lesvos, seeking for practical ways to help them.

Boxes of donated aid fill a large storehouse. Packed foodstuffs, piles of clothes, toys for children \u2013 they all have to be sorted, stored safely and distributed to the refugee camps, while more donations arrive every day.", "The volunteers start the day planning their field visits and other activities under the welcome shade of the trees, as smiling refugees file out from their tents to greet them. There's a shared languid serenity in this place, but also purpose: volunteers and refugees form loading-unloading brigades as cars file in and more people arrive, offering help every hour.", "A jeep bearing activists from a local social kitchen arrives, loading up an impressive amount of goods. Konstantinos Polychronopoulos and his colleagues manage small miracles, cooking on site for hundreds at the camps outside Mytilene every day. They started out by cooking for crisis-stricken people of all nationalities in Athens, but the current refugee crisis has focused their efforts on the islands this summer.

He's now part of a larger network of people supporting refugees in Lesvos from around the world.", "Over the next several days, I too will discover that sense of the surreal that many volunteers feel after departing the island.
